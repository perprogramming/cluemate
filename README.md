Cluemate
========

Cluemate is an advisory tool for the deduction board game [Clue](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluedo).  
As such it helps the player to make his next move based on the
game play information it collects continuosly.

Cluemate is the result of my participation in the course
"Functional and Declarative Programming" during my studies in
Computer Science at the [Bonn-Rhein-Sieg University of Applied Science](http://www.hochschule-bonn-rhein-sieg.de/en/Home.html).

Cluemate is written in [SWI-Prolog](http://www.swi-prolog.org/), an open source implementation of the declarative programming language Prolog.


Installation
============

After cloning the repository, you can compile the cluemate executable by running ./compile.  
The compilation requires the swipl binary in the current PATH (Version 6.2). Afterwards you
can start Cluemate by running: ./cluemate
